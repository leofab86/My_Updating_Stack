my_decorators v1.1.5

Description: Using React Router 4. App.js renders router, MainContainer connects to redux store and routes state.

Update: Untracked dist. Changed gulp and added frontend index.html to be able to run frontend build

ToDo: 
Implement Jest testing. 
Implement server side rendering or pre-written templates to render a basic page before React renders on the client.
Cache or cookie save user name and retrieve it on initial load before authentication returns success.
