v1.1.3

04/17/17

Description: Using React Router 4. App.js renders router, MainContainer connects to redux store and routes state.

Update: Switched to asynchronous authentication. Made tabs avoid unecessary render. Moved Statetracker to App.js before Router and connected it to store through STContainer.js.

ToDo: Implement Jest testing. Implement server side rendering or pre-written templates to render a basic page before React renders on the client.
